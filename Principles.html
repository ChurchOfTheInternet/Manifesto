Church of the Internet

Principles of the Wholly Internet

1) Forking is Good - Forking something means to copy something, then change the copy. Even the greatest individual accomplishments are dwarfed by what humans can achieve by working together. The internet could not have been built by one human, instead it was many humans building on the work of other humans, who built on the work of still others, going back many generations into our ancestry. Every child has a parent, every idea is a collage of other ideas, a filtered rainbow of references and inspirations. Every word is defined in terms of other words. Let us not scorn our past selves, those moments still present in memories living! Instead let us rejoice in the network! Fiat furca! Let there be forks! (If you don't like this manifesto, then fork it!)

2) Humans are Good - Humans made the internet. The internet is good because it lets humans communicate across vast distances, allowing them to work together on a scale previously impossible. You can't love the internet without loving people, because everything on the internet was made by people. If you hate the internet, it's probably because you hate people.

3) Information is neither Good nor Evil - Communication is the antidote to conspiracy. Too little communication breeds ignorance and confusion. Too much communication breeds waste and redundance. Global synchrony is seizure. Complete absence of synchrony is death. Humans today are exposed to much more information in a day than their ancestors encountered in their whole lives, and some data are healthier than others. Like different kinds of food, different kinds of information have different effects on the minds of individuals and society as a whole. Keep your mind healthy and think about what kind of information you consume!

4) Creativity is Chaos - Anything new will not be immediately recognized, because it cannot be retrieved from memory. Creation necessarily implies a destruction of something else, new things are made from the corpses of old, soil is a both a graveyard and a womb.
